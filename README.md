## Global Shader Example In UE4
Copyright (c) Fouad Valadbeigi (akoylasar@gmail.com)

## Introduction
This is a project that I did a year ago which I recently decided to share it on Github. It uses a global shader to render a ray traced scene onto the screen. The scene contains a refractive ball, a super simple "sky" and a ground floor.
It is basically [this](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/WtsyDX) in UE4 :)

### Interactivity
- The ball can be moved via the arrow keys and ```WASDQE```.
- Radius of the ball can be changed with the keys R (increase) and F (decrease).
- Index of refraction can be changed with the keys T (increase) and G (decrease).
- Lights are procedurally animated.

## Prerequisites
- [Unreal Engine 4.21.1](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/4.21.1-release)
- Windows 10
- Visual Studio 2017 (any edition)
